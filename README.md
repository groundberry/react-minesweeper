# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle video game. The goal of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" or bombs without detonating any of them, with help from clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.

## Functionality

- As a user, I can click on any cell of the board to discover hidden mines.
- As a user, I can see the number of mines around the cleared cell.
